## My process

I didnt see any need for media queries. I just set the card width to 350px which allows it to fit on most devices. Couldnt tell by the design if it was wider on desktop but it looks the same to me.
Plus i used the active state as a hover instead of active as i thought this looked better.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I have learned that this was too easy.
